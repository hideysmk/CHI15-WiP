\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The paper presents an understanding of the estimated costs of work in friendsourcing in comparison to crowdsourcing. 
Based on the study, we suggest that friendsourcing should be considered as paid rather than free services, 
although the payment would depend on stakeholders' perceptions of social relations and needs. 

Since friendsourcing is based on social relations, cultural factors need to be considered in the future. 
Our participants are all with an East Asian cultural background, which means that they build GuanXi with others, 
a type of social relationship unique to the Eastern culture \cite{Fan:InterBusinessReview02:GunaXiDef}. 
In other words, they may perceive more mutual obligations with their friends, 
and thus expect to pay more and take less in transactions with friends.
 
Furthermore, the sample proofreading task is a holistic one, 
which may increase friendsourcing requesters' perceived social debts, 
thus exacerbating the asymmetrical estimation between requesters and workers. 
It is necessary to further investigate the role of task granularity, 
and see if a divide-and-conquer strategy influences estimated costs.

Our next step is to develop a system for unleashing the power of friendsourcing, 
and our ultimate goal is to leverage the understanding to enable more beneficial, 
natural and versatile employment of one's social capital.
